TMK/chibios for Input Club Infinity Ergodox
===========================================

This is an unofficial keyboard firmware for Infinity Ergodox. 

[http://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox](http://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox)
    
It is based on Jun Wako's TMK firmware

[https://github.com/tmk/tmk_core](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_core) and [https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard). The readme files for those projects has a lot of useful information, as do the [Wiki](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/wiki).

News and important information
------------------------------
**Always read this section every time you pull a new version**

**15-May-2015**

* A [bug](https://github.com/fredizzimo/infinity_ergodox/issues/9) that corrupts the LCD and LCD backlight, after the keyboard has been on for a while has been fixed. It's strongly recommended to upgrade.

**10-Apr-2016**

* The location of most submodules have moved to my own forks. Therefore you need to run `git submodule sync --recursive` before doing `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Physical connection
-------------------
Connect the left half to the computer, and connect a link cable between the two halves.

The firmware does currently not work when chaining several keyboards together. So you are limited to a single keyboard consisting of a left hand plus a right hand. Another limitation is that you have to connect the left hand to the computer, and the right hand to the left one. Both of these limitations can quite easily be fixed in the future. However I can't test the chaining myself, so I need some help, open a ticket if you are interested.

Git notes
---------
This repository uses submodules, so after you:

* Clone the repository
* Pull a new version
* Switch a branch

You should run

1. `git submodule sync --recursive` (This is not strictly needed, but in case the location of the repositories changes, it's good to do)
1. `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Prerequisites
-------------
If you are using Windows, I recommend that you use Cygwin (that's what I'm using). I haven't tested any other operating systems, but if you can install the required tools it will probably work.

In order to compile the firmware you need:

1.  GNU make
1.  [GCC ARM Embedded](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded):
	* Note that the 5.x and 6.x versions don't work at the moment, so I recommend that you download the 4.9 version.
	* You can also download the ChibiStudio from [www.chibios.org](http://www.chibios.org), which comes with eclipse and other tools.
	* Make sure to add the bin folder to the path. In Cygwin you can edit .bash_profile in your home directory and add it. Here's what I added to the end of the file `PATH="${PATH}:/cygdrive/C/ChibiStudio/tools/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/4.9 2015q3/bin"`
	* For OSX, you can install the px4/px4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-49 brew package:
	
			brew tap px4/px4
			brew update
			brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi-49
		
1. dfu-util:

 	* On windows you also need to install some drivers. You can find more detailed instructions on the [Kiibohd controller wiki page](https://github.com/kiibohd/controller/wiki/Loading-DFU-Firmware). You also need to ensure that dfu-util is in your path.
 	
	* On OSX, you can install `dfu-util` via brew: `brew install dfu-util`

Build
-----
Just run  
$ make  
to build the everything.

Upload
------
To upload(flash) a new firmware to the keyboard, first enter the bootloader mode, either by pressing the dedicated flash button on the bottom of the keyboard, or by pressing a mapped bootloader button.

The default layout has that button mapped on layer 2(keyboard functions). 

When the keyboard is in bootloader mode, and the LCD is red with no text, you can run this command.

$ make program

For simple layout updates, you only need to flash the master(left) half. But each time there's a new firmware version or if you want to make some visualization changes, you need to flash them both.

Changing keyboard layout
------------------------
Changing the keyboard layout works the same way as for the other TMK based keyboards. So read [this](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/wiki/FAQ-Keymap).

LCD Visualization
-----------------
In order to customize the LCD visualization, which includes both the backlight and the LCD screen display itself, you need to edit the visualizer\_user.c file. The file is quite well commented, so just read through the comments, and start experimenting. At the very least you probably want to edit the layer names and colors, in the update\_user\_visualizer\_state function.

Currently there's no support for LED visualization. That should be easy to add, but I haven't installed LED's myself, so I would be unable to test. Contributions are welcome, but I can also consider making this myself if someone is willing to test. So open a ticket if you are interested.
